The goal of the project is to create a movie recommendation algorithm.
We scrape the website letterboxd.com to collect data on a large number of films.
We also scrape the profiles of consenting users of the site so that we can recommend films to them based on their tastes.
The various parameters collected per film include, for example:
- Genre (19 possible)
- The main actors
- The directors
- The year of release (or decade)
- The country of production

Using this data, we can create a vector representing the film.
To do this, we need to transform the text values ​​into numeric vectors.
On the user side, we need to average the vectors of the films they have seen.
This average can optionally be weighted by the rating given to the film by the user.
Then, we can use algorithms like K-NN to suggest the films that most closely match the user's profile.
